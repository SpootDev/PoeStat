### `mods.json`

Describes mod ids. Defines which items they can appear on and what stats with what
values they have.

The file is an object where each key is a mod id that has its description object
as value. That description object has the following fields:

**General information**

- `name`: The display name of the mod in case of "normally" spawnable mods (Prefixes
  and Suffixes).
  Can be an empty string or some other string in case it is never seen (can't appear
  on magic items).
- `required_level`: The level requirement of the mod.
  
**Granted stats, buffs and effects**
  
- `stats`: Array of the stats this mod gives. `id` is the stat id and `min` and `max`
  (both inclusive) define the range the stat can roll. These can be resolved with
  `stats.json` and converted to text with `stat_translations.json`.
- `grants_buff`: The stats of this mod may be applied to allies or enemies around the mod
  carrier. If they are, this field contains the buff id (resolved in `Buffs.dat`)
  and the range the buff is applied. If the range is 0 and the buff is applied to
  allies, it only affects the carrier. The buff referenced by the id specifies
  the stats of this mod that are applied to others and some information for
  display purposes.
- `grants_effects`: Active gem and support gem like effects this mod gives.
  The two fields (`granted_effect_id` and `level`) identify a single row in
  `GrantedEffectsPerLevel.dat`. These can be resolved with `gems.json`:
  `granted_effect_id` is a key in the root dictionary and `level` is a key in the 
  `per_level` object of the object for `granted_effect_id`.

**Spawning/generating**

- `adds_tags`: Tags that are added to an item if it has this mod. These are taken into
  consideration when spawning other mods, see `spawn_weights` and `generation_weights`.
- `domain`: The domain this mod appears on. See 
  [`PyPoE.poe.constants.MOD_DOMAIN`](http://omegak2.net/poe/PyPoE/_autosummary/PyPoE.poe.constants.html#PyPoE.poe.constants.MOD_DOMAIN)
  for the possible values and explanation.
- `generation_type`: How this mod is generated. See
  [`PyPoE.poe.constants.MOD_MOD_GENERATION_TYPE`](http://omegak2.net/poe/PyPoE/_autosummary/PyPoE.poe.constants.html#PyPoE.poe.constants.MOD_GENERATION_TYPE)
  for the possible values and explanation.
- `group`: Some kind of mod grouping, see the file for examples. For normally spawnable
  mods, only one mod of a group can appear on an item at the same time.
- `is_essence_only`: True iff the mod can only be generated by essences.
- `spawn_weights`: Defines on which items of the domain this mod can be spawned/crafted
  on. Only contains elements for mods that appear "normally", e.g. not for
  master crafted mods or essences. The array elements are evaluated in order,
  the first element with a tag (value of the `tag` property) the item in question 
  has is taken. If the object with that tag `weight` greater than zero, the mod can
  spawn on the item and the weight defines the relative weight of it spawning. If it 
  has `weight` zero, the mod can not spawn.  
  The mod `AddedChaosDamageCorrupted1`,  for example, has `no_attack_mods` with 
  weight 0, `ring` with weight 1000 and `default` with weight 0. It can therefore 
  spawn on items that do
  not have Catarina's "Cannot roll Attack Mods" mod and are rings, but not on
  any other item.  
  The possible tags can be found in `tags.json`. To get the tags a base item has,
  see `base_items.json`.
- `generation_weights`: This is an array with the same structure as `spawn_weights`.
  The weights are percentage multipliers to the spawn weight obtained through 
  `spawn_weights`. If `generation_weights` is empty, the spawn weight is not modified.
- `type`: gives a finer grouping than the `group`. This descriptor refers to an entry 
  in `mod_types.json` which has with it a list of tags affecting fossil crafting
  and the effect of the mod on the vendor sell price

See `tags.json` for the possible tags, though not all of those are relevant for mods.
See `mod_types.json` for the possible types.

Only mods of the domains 'item', 'flask', 'area', 'master', 'jewel' and 'atlas' are 
included. If you need other domains, just ask.
