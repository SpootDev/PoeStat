### `characters.json`

The file is an array where each element is an object describing a player character class
(its `name`, `integer_id` and `metadata_id`) and its base stat values (in `base_stats`).
This includes `attack_time` (in ms), physical attack damage and attack range for unarmed
combat (in `base_stats.unarmed`).
